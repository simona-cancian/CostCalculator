# CostCalculator
A Windows Forms application designed to help users estimate their total cost of traveling and determine the weekly savings required to reach the total by a specific date. This project showcases my learning journey in C# and Windows Forms development.

## Features
- Transportation Costs: Input fields for specific transportation expenses such as Ferry, Flight, and Fuel.
- Food Costs: Input fields for expenses like Groceries and Extras.
- Date Selection: Use the MonthCalendar control to select the target date for achieving your savings goal.
- Weekly Savings Calculation: Automatically calculates the weekly savings needed based on the input expenses and selected date.
- Progress Bar: Visual representation of your savings progress towards the total travel cost. The progress bar updates based on your current savings compared to the total estimated travel cost.

This project was developed to document my learning journey of C# and Windows Forms development. The main goals were:

- To gain experience with using Windows Forms and C# syntax.
- To practice parsing and handling user input.
- To calculate values based on user input and display the results.
- To understand the build process in Visual Studio.
